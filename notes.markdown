I will present my daily work and study notes in this page.

## Vlasov-MagnetoHydrodynamics set of equations <sub>[[pdf]](/assets/files/MHD_equations.pdf)</sub>      
The main work of my Ph.D. project involves using the Vlasov-Magnetohydrodynamics set of equations,
    combined with [*Solar Obiter*](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Solar_Orbiter) observations and our simulation code,
    to reveal the velocity distribution functions of particles in the solar wind.
The physical basis, including the derivation and physical meaning of these equations, is reviewed in the document.
This document will be continuously updated to include the majority of the theoretical part of my Ph.D.



## Coulomb collisions in the young solar wind   
Coulomb collisions, which refer to slight deflections of charged particles due to the interactions among them, play a critical role in shaping the velocity distributions of the ions and electrons in the solar wind.
Collisions among particles provide the fundamental mechanism through which an ionized plasma increases its entropy and ultimately comes into thermal equilibrium.
In this document, we reviewed important works related to this topic, and present some early-stage results we obtained from *Parker Solar Probe*.
I plan to further continue this work in my Ph.D., therefore the pdf file will not be available until this work is finished.


## Application of High-resolution High-precision Spectral Observations in Solar Physics <sub>[[pdf]](/assets/files/Spectral_study.pdf)</sub>

With but few exceptions, quantitatively researches of the Sun are based on the interpretation of spectroscopic observations.
In this review, we introduced how the Zeeman effect and Doppler shifts are used to measure some key properties.
Some important wavelengths that used to study the solar atmosphere were also highlighted.
This is the work of my research intern at the Nanjing Institute of Astronomical Optics and Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
