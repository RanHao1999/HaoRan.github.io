Dear Hao in 2028:   
Hi!   

You must have gone through an extrodinary four years, perhaps facing many challenges as well as experiencing many joyful moments.
Your perspective on the world and yourself may have changed, but I hope you can proudly tell me that you have preserved your shining essense during these four years.
I hope you've been trying your best to remain honest and positive, seriously and actively developing yourself while positively impacting others, and sincerely treating your friends.   

I wonder what job you've found now (lol).
Have you joined the booming development of commercial space exploration, continued in academia, or perhaps decided to take a more relaxed job to enjoy life?
Whatever path you've chosen, I support you!
Any decision you make, in my eyes, is a result of the combination of reality's influence and our mind.
Whatever you choose is valid, as long as you can stay happy and healthy.   


The opportunity to study and work with Daniel at MSSL is truly invaluable, so I hope you can seize it to enhance yourself to the fullest! 
Let us set a few goals: 
become a contributor to SunPy; 
generalize your problem-solving codes and contribute them to the broader scientific community; 
become one of the most knowledgeable workers on Solar Orbiter and deeply engage in this revolutionary program; 
and in addition to the academic field, keep an eye on the developments in the space industry, so you donâ€™t confine yourself to just your current area of expertise.


As for your love life, there is no need to force it.
If you happen to find someone worthwhile, make sure you put in the effort that you don't have any regrets!
If you don't, that is ok. 
We can get all the emotional energy we need from within ourselves.
(But I still hope you can find someone beautiful and kind, lol. Try not to let me down!)


Make sure to video call mom often, buy more gifts to dad, and keep an eye on your brother!
Remember to spend more time with your friends, no matter how busy or tired you are.
Always show your most emotionally stable side to the people that you love the most!
I've done my best to keep this so far.
But you might be facing challenges much tougher than mine now, so you'll need to put in even more effort!


That's it! I hope everything is going on well for you, and that you remain as passionate about the future as I am now!
Whatever happens to you, please believe that everything happens for a reason, everything leads to the best.



Best regards,    
     Hao from 2024.08.09
